//Temlate Literals:


const age=20;
const fullName="john Doe";
//output:Hello Mr john Doe your age is:20
console.log("Hello Mr "+fullName+" your age is: "+age);
console.log(`Hello Mr ${fullName} your age is: ${age}`);//using Template litereals


//Q.print sum of two numbers
const a=10;
const b=20;
console.log("20"+a);
console.log("Sum of "+a+" and "+b+" is "+a+b);
console.log(`Sum of ${a} and ${b} is ${a+b}`);//in string literals you can perform mathemetical operation but in case of string you cannot do math.random()
